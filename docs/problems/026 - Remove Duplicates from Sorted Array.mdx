# 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/description

## Definition

$$
\begin{align}
L = \text{List of integers sorted in ascending order}\\
N = |L| = \text{ Size of the list L}\\
i = \text{Index of the last unique element from partial solution}\\
j = \text{Index of the prospective element to be the last unique element from partial solution}
\end{align}
$$

## Intuition

The idea is to find the next element $L[j]$ which is different from current element $L[i]$. Since the list $L$ is already sorted, it is guaranteed that $L[j] >= L[i]$. Thus, when $L[i] != L[j]$, we should apply these operations:

$$
\begin{align}
L[i + 1] = L[j]\\
i = i + 1\\
j = j + 1
\end{align}
$$

These steps repeats until $j < N$, e.g., when $j$ is still a valid index.

## Ilustration

export const example = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3];

### Initial state

$i$ and $j$ starts pointing to the first and second elements respectively.
It is safe to make $j$ point to the second element even for a list of a single element because the stop condition is $j < N$. For lists of size 1, this condition will break and the algorithm stops because $1 < 1 == false$.

<ArrayPointers
  data={example}
  pointers={[
    { index: 0, label: "i", color: "red", position: "TOP" },
    { index: 1, label: "j", color: "green", position: "BOTTOM" },
  ]}
/>

### 1<sup>st</sup> iteration

$j$ moves forward trying to find an element other than $i$

<ArrayPointers
  data={example}
  pointers={[
    { index: 0, label: "i", color: "red", position: "TOP" },
    { index: 2, label: "j", color: "green", position: "BOTTOM" },
  ]}
/>

### 2<sup>rd</sup> Iteration

$j$ moves forward and now points to a different element

<ArrayPointers
  data={example}
  pointers={[
    { index: 0, label: "i", color: "red", position: "TOP" },
    { index: 3, label: "j", color: "green", position: "BOTTOM" },
  ]}
/>

Now we copy $L[j]$ to $L[i + 1]$ and increment both pointers

<ArrayPointers
  data={[1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]}
  pointers={[
    { index: 1, label: "i", color: "red", position: "TOP" },
    { index: 4, label: "j", color: "green", position: "BOTTOM" },
  ]}
/>

### 3<sup>rd</sup> Iteration

$j$ moves forward and now points to a different element

<ArrayPointers
  data={example}
  pointers={[
    { index: 1, label: "i", color: "red", position: "TOP" },
    { index: 5, label: "j", color: "green", position: "BOTTOM" },
  ]}
/>

Now we copy $L[j]$ to $L[i + 1]$ and increment both pointers

<ArrayPointers
  renderOutOfBoundCell
  data={[1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3]}
  pointers={[
    { index: 2, label: "i", color: "red", position: "TOP" },
    { index: 7, label: "j", color: "green", position: "BOTTOM" },
  ]}
/>

### 4<sup>th</sup> Iteration

Since $j = 7$ and $7 < 7 == false$, the algorithm finishes and returns the resulting list size, in this case it is $i + 1 == 3$. Thus, the final response is:

<pre class="sample">
  1 2 3 <span class="strike">2 2 3 3</span>
</pre>

## Time complexity

Since the list is being completely iterated from left to right through pointer $j$, the complexity is $O(n)$

## Space complexity

Since the list is being modified in-place and no other allocations besides auxiliary variables are made, the complexity is $O(1)$
